Hi, 
The lack of CPTextView is a show stopper for me. 
So i started to implementing it myself. 
I fortunaltey found some nearly finished stuff at github (emaillard/ 
cappuccino). However, that did not work together with recent 
Cappuccino versions. 
I managed to port the code to the recent API. After some fixing and 
tweaking it gives basic functionality (selection, editing, keyboard 
navigation, scrollview interaction), albeit typing experience is on 
the slower end of the spectrum.
Please help in finishing this up.
Best greetings,
Daniel
